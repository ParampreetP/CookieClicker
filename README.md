# CookieClicker

Team Project I worked on with 3 other students for CS441 - Game Dev For Mobile Applications

MaddenClicker is a cookie clicker clone. The main menu screen allows the user to
navigate through the app between various screens. The game screen allows a user to
accumulate points by clicking Prof. Maddenâ€™s face at the center of the screen. The leaderboard
displays the top scores of players based on their number of clicks. The prestige screen allows
the user to reset their points if they reach a certain number of Maddens.
